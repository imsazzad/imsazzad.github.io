        description: "\"The very first thing that I can say about Sazzad is that he is a very enthusiastic learner. Back in 2011 we were both part of a Software Engineering study group, and even though he was still a student and had tons of coursework he still managed to attend all the regular study sessions. This also shows that he is a hard worker. He has very good knowledge of OOP and basic Software Engineering as well. As a person he is very humble, modest, and helpful. I wish him all the best in his career!\""

He is grooming himself up with a diversified set of software development skills and has a lot of potential. He is very receptive to feedback and takes a great interest in doing things the right way. A very adaptive person Sazzad has the courage to pick up work on areas that he hasnâ€™t worked in before and his enthusiasm is very impressive. I had an enjoyable experience with Sazzad and wish to see him contributing to the community as a great software developer going forward.\""
